# About-Us

Hello All,

The Lincoln Sudbury Mutual Aid Network is a mutual aid organization based in Massachusetts. Our goal is to connect members of our community together to help each other.

We currently provide volunteer-matching services (connecting volunteers to requests within the community) as well as maintaining collections of resources available in the Lincoln-Sudbury community, in Massachusetts, and nationwide (these resources range from local food pantry contact information, to filing for unemployment, to national human rights petitions).

We created the LS Mutual Aid Network in response to the current COVID-19 pandemic, in hopes that local organizing and community support can help mitigate the impact that the coronavirus is having on peoples' lives; we hope this network is helpful and that it will continue to be a presence in our community long after this pandemic is over. 

Together, we got this.
